Hi, my name is Sagang Wee and I am a student at the University of California, Berkeley pursuing a major in Computer Science and minor in Korean. In my free time, I like to learn how to develop new things, watch chess commentaries, hike, swim, play board and card games, hoard books that make me feel smart, attend hackathons, and read style blogs. I also have a mild obsession with socks.
