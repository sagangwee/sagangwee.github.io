Hi, my name is Sagang Wee and I am a student at the University of California, Berkeley pursuing a major in Computer Science. In my free time, I like to learn how to develop new things, watch philosophical videos, try new food, hike, swim, play board and card games, read classic literature and enlightening non-fiction, and attend hackathons. I also have a mild obsession with socks.
