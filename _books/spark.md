Serotonin influences mood, implusivity, anger, and aggressiveness. Norepinephrine often amplifies signals that influence mood, attention, perception, motivation, and arousal. Exercise balances serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the brain.

* Exercise was found to increase BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in the hippocampus (receives memory fragments from the cortex and bundles them together), which helps build and maintain cell circuitry. Thus, exercise improves the rate of learning (a 2007 German study found people learn vocab words 20% faster after exercise). 

* Exercise optimizes energy usage by triggering the production of more insulin receptors, meaning better use of blood glucose and stronger cells. It also increases IGF-1, which helps insulin manage glucose levels. In the hippocampus, IGF-1 increases LTP (long-term potentiation, neuron strengthening during learning), neuroplasticity, and neurogenesis. Exercise also produces FGF-2 and VEGF, which build new capillaries and expand the vascular system in the brain. 

* In a 2000 Duke University study, exercise was shown to be better than sertraline (Zoloft) at treating depression.

* Exercise increases the efficiency of the cardiovascular system, lowering blood pressure. As heart rate increases, a hormone called atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is produced that tempers the body's stress response. 

* Sprinting produces human growth hormone (HGH), staying in the bloodstream for up to 4 hours (usually only stays a few minutes). HGH burns belly fat, layers muscle fiber, and pumps up brain volume. In the brain, HGH balances neurotransmitter levels and boost production of growth factors, especially IGF-1.
