Mr. White!

* "This is what you shall do; Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labor to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience and indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life, re-examine all you have been told at school or church or in any book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul, and your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in every motion and joint of your body."

* "I exist as I am, that is enough. If no other in the world be aware I sit content. And if each and all be aware I sit content."

* "Thruster holding me tight and that I hold tight! We hurt each other as the bridegroom and the bride hurt each other."

* "Encompass worlds but never try to encompass me."

* "The past and present wilt...I have filled and emptied them, And proceed to fill my next fold of the future."

* "I am large...I contain multitudes."

* "I too am not a bit tamed...I too am untranslatable, I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world."
