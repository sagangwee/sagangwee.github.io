* The current K-12 education system with its class periods and distinct subjects is based on the Prussian model of education developed in the 18th century. Khan argues that this system (largely unchanged for 120+ years) is outdated and that fragmented subjects "could be learned by rote memorization, whereas mastering larger ideas called for free and unbridled thinking." He also proposes doing away with school grades, since then older kids can mentor the younger kids, everyone can learn at their own paces, and there would be greater collaboration overall. In addition, he wants to redefine summer vacation, so that schools are more like companies in that you can take a vacation whenever you want, but are constantly learning throughout the whole year.

* One of Sal Khan's favorite books is Pride and Prejudice. Man I really need to get around to reading that book.

* A really neat idea to provide a world-class education to the under-served supported by the middle and upper class without taxation: A lot of countries in South and East Asia invest a ton of money into after-hours tutoring. Khan suggests building computer centers with software like Khan Academy that the well-to-do families pay to use after school, while poor/currently unschooled students could use the centers during the day for free. Pretty neat.

* At MIT, Khan used to hyper-optimize his learning time by skipping passive lectures and instead actively engaging with say, a textbook, online videos, or interactive assessments. He, along with his roommate Shantanu and others, were able to take on an insane course load (up to 8 or 9 courses) while maintaining good grades. "The idea was to work effectively, naturally, and independently."
