1. Be Impeccable With Your Word. Always speak the truth. 

2. Don't Take Anything Personally. People are dealing with their problems and spheres of reality. 

3. Don't Make Assumptions. Be as clear as possible. Communicate.

4. Always Do Your Best. You can never feel bad if you always give it you all.
