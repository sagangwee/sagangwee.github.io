Verily, difficult to parse, verily, can get boring, but verily, I love the camel, lion, dragon, child metaphor. 

* "The child is innocence and forgetting, a new beginning, a game, a self-propelled wheel, a first movement, a sacred 'Yes.' For the game of creation, my brothers, a sacred 'Yes' is needed: the spirit now wills his own will, and he who had been lost to the world now conquers his own world."

* "True, we love life, not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving. There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness."

* "And if a friend does you evil, then say: 'I forgive you what you did to me; but that you have done it to _yourself_—how could I forgive that?' Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity."

* "And there is nobody from whom I want beauty as much as from you who are powerful: let your kindness be your final self-conquest." Be kind if you have power—that is beauty and goodness.

* "Courage, however, is the best slayer—courage which attacks: which slays even death itself, for it says, 'Was _that_ life? Well then! Once more!'" Bring it on!
