Witty, entertaining, informative.

Humans have an insane number of physical attributes adapted for long-distance running:

* Nuchal ligament behind head that stabilizes the head when moving fast

* Big butt to "prevent the momentum of your upper body from flipping you onto your face"

* Achilles tendon stretches like a rubber band - great for energy-efficient jumping

* Arched feet, short and straight toes which helps running

* Vertical bodies retain less heat, sweat glands

Running shoes suck for running:

* "Runners wearing top-of-the-line shoes are 123 percent more likely to get injured than runners in cheap shoes."

* The impact of your legs from running can be up to twelve time your body weight.

* "The more cushioned the shoes, the less protection it provides." "Your legs and feet instinctively come down hard when they sense something squishy underfoot." They're trying to push through the soles "in search of a hard, stable platform."

* Placing a support underneath the arch of the foot is worthless: you lose its natural capability to naturally flex and stretch. There are twenty-six bones, thirty-three joints, twelve rubbery tendons, and eighteen muscles in the foot. Natural engineering.

* Lesson: Wear shoes with minimal "support". Get as close to bare-foot running as possible. Nike ruined an entire generation of runners for profit.
