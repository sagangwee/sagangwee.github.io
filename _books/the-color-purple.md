Throws you immediately into the brutal world of Celie, an African American woman in what appears to be early 20th century Georgia (there are mentions of ship sinkings like those during World War I). Testament to how far we have come in terms of societal norms in just a hundred years and the power of literature to place the reader in the mindsets of others and foster empathy. 

* "I say, Until you do right by me, everything you touch will crumble. He laugh. Who you think you is? he say. You can't curse nobody. Look at you. You black, you pore, you ugly, you a woman. Goddam, he say, you nothing at all. Until you do right by me, I say, everything you even dream about will fail. I give it to him straight, just like it come to me. And it seem to come to me from the trees. I'm pore, I'm black, I may be ugly and can't cook, a voice say to everything listening. But I'm here."

* "That's not what I'm telling you. I'm telling you _I_ won't be able to love your own son. You can love him just as much as you want to. But be ready to suffer the consequences. That's how the colored live."

* "I think us here to wonder, myself. To wonder. To ast. And that in wondering bout the big things and asting bout the big things, you learn about the little ones, almost by accident. But you never know nothing more about the big things than you start out with. The more I wonder, he say, the more I love."
