The most horrifying book I've ever read. Absolutely devastating.  
Some atrocities over just a seven week period: 

* 20000 - 80000 women ages 12 to 80 were raped
* About 340000 people killed
* About 200000 women sent into sexual slavery in "comfort houses"
* Bayonetted babies into boiling water
* Hang people by their tongues on metal hooks
* Disemboweled women, sliced off their breasts and then nailed them to alive to walls
* The Yangzte River literally ran red with blood  

Lesson: When totalitarian regimes oppress the individual to the point where the individual loses all value and is treated as a means rather than an end (Kant anyone?) people can view others as insects or "pigs" (Japanese soldier: "A pig is more valuable now than the life of a [Chinese] human being. That's because a pig is edible."). They can become utterly ruthless and unfeeling.
