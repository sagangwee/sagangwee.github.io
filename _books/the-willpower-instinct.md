A lot of over-used pyschological studies (Phineas Gage, marshmallow experiment) and over-played advice (meditate, exercise, sleep, eat good food). Some nuggets of practical advice and info though.

* Why it's important: "Self-control is a better predictor of academic success than intelligence, a stronger determinant of effective leadership than charisma, and more important for marital bliss than empathy."

* "Meditators have more gray matter in the prefrontal cortex, as well as regions of the brain that support self-awareness." In just 8 weeks, can see changes in the brain and increased neural connections in regions of the brain important for "staying focused, ignoring distractions, and controlling impulses." The brain truly is malleable! All you have to do is focus on your breathing and when your mind wanders, refocus on your breathing. Inhale. Exhale.

* "Fatigue should no longer be considered a physical event but rather a sensation or emotion." The body can go a lot further if you push past what your brain is telling you.

* Self-control acts like a muscle, and you can train it through small acts of willpower (e.g. stop swearing). The acts of noticing the act and choosing the more difficult option is what is important.

* _Moral licensing_: doing something "good" rationalizes doing something "bad." People who remember doing a past good deed donate 60% less to a charitable request.

* Progress can be detrimental and lead to _goal liberation_, where people give themselves permission to give into temptations. Instead view progress as being _committed_ to your goal. "I did that because I _wanted_ to."

* Self-compassion makes people more likely to take personal responsibility. 

* "When reflecting on the future self, the brain's activation is identical to when it is considering thr traits of another person." Visualizing your future self can help you be more willing to invest in your future _now_.
