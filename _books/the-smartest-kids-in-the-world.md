Many countries, especially Finland, Poland, and South Korea are outperforming the US on international critical thinking tests like the PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) primarily due to substantial differences in rigor, which trickle down into how teachers view their students and how students view themselves and their education. 

* Finland's education programs are very selective, on the order of MIT, and are well-respected like doctors are in the US.

* US education programs have very low standards compared to countries like Finland (US teacher-training colleges only require on average 12-15 weeks of student teaching compared to a year in Finland) and combined with a large surplus that saturates the teacher supply (about 186,000 teachers graduate in the US each year, only about 77,000 get jobs) "dumb down the profession."

* Smaller average class size isn't always better: the highest performing countries typically have larger classes than the US. Research shows the quality of teaching matters more than class size.

* Black and Hispanic students were more likely to attend majority black or Hispanic schools in 2005 than they were in 1980.

* Parents who volunteered in their kids' extracurricular activities had children who performed *worse* in reading on average. Being involved in one's children's school work, like reading to them, asking what they are learning, or discussing current events is more important for engagement and interest.
