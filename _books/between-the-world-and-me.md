Very much like James Baldwin.

* "struggle, in and of itself, has meaning."

* "love could be soft and understanding; that, soft or hard, love was an act of heroism."

* "...because my death would not be the fault of any human but the fault of some unfortunate but _immutable_ fact of 'race,' _imposed_ upon an _innocent_ country by the _inscrutable_ judgment of _invisible_ gods." Damnnnnn. That assonance though.
