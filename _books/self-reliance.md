Pretty dry, but insightful.

* "Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world."

* "but truth is handsomer than the affectation of love. Your goodness must have some edge to it,-else it is none."

* "but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude."

* "Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life's cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous, half possession."

On friendship:

* "There must be very two, before there can be very one."

* "There can never be deep peace between two spirits, never mutual respect, until, in their dialogue, each stands for the whole world."

* "The only reward of virtue is virtue; the only way to have a friend is to be one."
